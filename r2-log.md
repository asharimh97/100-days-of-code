### Day 34: Sunday, 7 February 2021

### Day 50: Tuesday, 23 February 2021

Continue create components, after try some approach, decided to keep the `Layout` approach instead of wrap page element approach for now, since it gives no different to the implementation.

### Day 84: Monday, 29 March 2021

Tried recoil.js (again) inside the preact project, now that I've tried another state management library like react-query, I think I implemented recoil js in a better way than I used to.

### Day 85: Tuesday, 30 March 2021

Did some experiments on websocket, I could get the grasp of it, actually I want to try Primus JS but once I implemented in Preact, it doesn't work, so I use socket io for now. Hmm...

### Day 86: Wednesday, 31 March 2021

Finally I am able to use primus as websocket service both in server and client, but yeah it's easier implementing socket.io as websocket service. Anyway it's worth learning!

Continue learn about react server components, can't wait its release. Then since I'm quite confused on what to learn, decided to take a look at https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks, surprisingly there are tons of learning material there.
