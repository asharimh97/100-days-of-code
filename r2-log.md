Finish reading Typescript in 50 Lessons by Stefan Baumgartner. There are some parts I'm not fully understand yet but I know the fundamentals. The book is really great, it explains Typescript really well, although there are also some parts I wish were inside the books. But worry not, it means my journey in Typescript is still very long. Let's pick up the pace. Gracias!
