Still continue my stepback from yesterday, today I started reading the Atomic Design by Brad Frost. Right now I just take "atomic design" for granted without knowing a deeper reason behind it. I want to know the principle better so I know what I am doing.

**Link to work**

- [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35496817-atomic-design)

### Day 34: Sunday, 7 February 2021

TIL atomic design is not just a step by step atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. It's much more than that, it's a mental model. Thankfully I reset my perspective sooner, so I could appreciate it more.

### Day 35: Monday, 8 February 2021

### Day 37: Wednesday, 10 February 2021

### Day 41: Sunday, 14 February 2021

### Day 42: Monday, 15 February 2021

Continue configuring typescript, add some typescript declaration files, add xstyled. I am thinking of replacing styled-system with xstyled because I feel xstyled is more efficient to handle custom style props.

Oh also redesigning the web and learning Figma at the same time. What is variant anyway?

**Link to work**

- [I am Ashari web repo](https://www.github.com/asharimh97/profile)

### Day 43: Tuesday, 16 February 2021

### Day 50: Tuesday, 23 February 2021

Continue create components, after try some approach, decided to keep the `Layout` approach instead of wrap page element approach for now, since it gives no different to the implementation. Also implement the xstyled config, well it crash with the previous layout setting, but it's fine since xstyled and styled-system has a quite different implementation.
