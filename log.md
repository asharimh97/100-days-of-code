# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepare for the real deal, set up mind, things, devices, start reading the rules in **The Odin Project**. 

**Thoughts:** I see many of the course are still to basic, I'm sure I have known some of them and been using in my daily basis. I'll try to re-read it carefully and try to look up for something in case I missed some points when I learned those topics back then. I've thought to skip some step as well since it's too basic. Let's see...

### Day 1: June 29 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google landing page using HTML, CSS (with BEM).

**Thoughts** 

It's been a while constructing HTML, CSS, and add some JS without any framework, CLI, helper, etc. My VSCode's emmet doesn't work as I expected as well. Honestly because I mainly focus on create react component on my daily basis, I forgot many things about HTML tags, especially `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

I think I should learn more about BEM CSS and get used to construct website with HTML, CSS, JS without any framework/CLI/helper. Anyway BEM CSS is very interesting, I also should learn more about it!
