# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepare for the real deal, set up mind, things, devices, start reading the rules in **The Odin Project**.

**Thoughts:** I see many of the course are still to basic, I'm sure I have known some of them and been using in my daily basis. I'll try to re-read it carefully and try to look up for something in case I missed some points when I learned those topics back then. I've thought to skip some step as well since it's too basic. Let's see...

### Day 1: June 29 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google landing page using HTML, CSS (with BEM).

**Thoughts**

It's been a while constructing HTML, CSS, and add some JS without any framework, CLI, helper, etc. My VSCode's emmet doesn't work as I expected as well. Honestly because I mainly focus on create react component on my daily basis, I forgot many things about HTML tags, especially `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

I think I should learn more about BEM CSS and get used to construct website with HTML, CSS, JS without any framework/CLI/helper. Anyway BEM CSS is very interesting, I also should learn more about it!

### Day 2: June 30 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google search result page

**Thoughts**

I didn't expect create website page without any framework will take time so long and so complicated (ribet). I should learn more element naming management so I won't get confused when it comes to giving class name to HTML element.

### Day 3: July 1 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learn about regular expression with The Net Ninja

**Thoughts**

Actually it's a bit cheating since in the rule, online couse shouldn't be counted, well yeah I agree but regex is one of many javascript topics that I was terrible at. I didn't expect it's actually simple, easy, and so much fun. I could be at least quite confident to bring it to my daily project.

### Day 4: July 2 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made a rock paper scissors game with Javascript

**Thoughts**

Create a simple game using Javascript is quite fun. It's so simple when we just play around logic and console, but it's another story when it comes to combine our logic into HTML element and play with css classes.

Now I know that if you `clearInterval()` the `setInterval()` will still run unless you wrap them in an `if else`.

### Day 5: July 3 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Javascript unit tester `Jasmine`

**Thoughts**

I didn't know that there's another unit tester other than `jest`. It's quite fun playing logic and algorithm with Jasmine. From the experience, I learn that my algorithm still quite weak and I still don't know about many things such as rounding numbers without `toFixed()` -- because it turns your number into String, be careful -- temperature ratios, etc. Still so many things to finish inside javascript exercise. Let's save it for tomorrow.

### Day 6: July 4 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade Next JS dashboard boilerplate to v9

**Thoughts**

It's not as simple as I thought, upgrade node js version from 8 to 12.18, upgrade all dependencies, new folder structure and behavior of many libraries suhc as `Next JS, next redux wrapper, styled components, styled system, etc`.

### Day 7: July 5 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finish upgrade Next JS dashboard to v9

**Thoughts**

As I said, migrating system to the newer one is not that simple, I should wary about new behavior, new libraries, updated dependency especially major version of it may be harder than I think. Fortunately all features have been migrated and tested without any error. Fyuh.

It's a nice experience though. I should re-check it.

### Day 8: July 6 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finish Etch sketch task and some javascript algorithm exercises

**Thoughts**

Create a pixelated canvas using HTML grid by using Javascript to generate it is quite easy, but I don't know somehow the performance is quite poor. I'm wondering what is wrong with my code.

On the other hand, javascript exercises today is quite hard. The most difficult task is caesar problem. We should make it circular in alphabet, **the circular** thing is the hardest one, we should _change the direction of encryption_ if it "tembus" below "a" alphabet. Palindrome problem also quite tricky in my opinion.

I think I've met the problem before, but since I am using Javascript instead of C++, I think it becomes easier than back then, but I **really** should learn more about algorithm and make my mind into shape.

### Day 9: July 7 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting calculator project

**Thoughts**

Wondering how to calculate string sequence without using `eval`. An hour isn't enough to figure out the solution, so today I wasted my time on thinking and just writing a small piece of code.

### Day 10: July 8 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finish method to calculate string into number

**Thoughts**

After receiving opinion from Alvis and Faldy to calculate string number sequence , finally finish the core function to calculate them. They suggested using recursion but since I am not good at recursion, I used while loop to solve the problem.

Save the numbers input into string and separate each number and operator with space `" "`, clean then calculate operator `*` and `/` first, then clean and calculate `+` and `-`. Voila you get the result number.
