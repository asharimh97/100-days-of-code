# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepare for the real deal, set up mind, things, devices, start reading the rules in **The Odin Project**.

**Thoughts:** I see many of the course are still to basic, I'm sure I have known some of them and been using in my daily basis. I'll try to re-read it carefully and try to look up for something in case I missed some points when I learned those topics back then. I've thought to skip some step as well since it's too basic. Let's see...

### Day 1: June 29 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google landing page using HTML, CSS (with BEM).

**Thoughts**

It's been a while constructing HTML, CSS, and add some JS without any framework, CLI, helper, etc. My VSCode's emmet doesn't work as I expected as well. Honestly because I mainly focus on create react component on my daily basis, I forgot many things about HTML tags, especially `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

I think I should learn more about BEM CSS and get used to construct website with HTML, CSS, JS without any framework/CLI/helper. Anyway BEM CSS is very interesting, I also should learn more about it!

### Day 2: June 30 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google search result page

**Thoughts**

I didn't expect create website page without any framework will take time so long and so complicated (ribet). I should learn more element naming management so I won't get confused when it comes to giving class name to HTML element.

### Day 3: July 1 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learn about regular expression with The Net Ninja

**Thoughts**

Actually it's a bit cheating since in the rule, online couse shouldn't be counted, well yeah I agree but regex is one of many javascript topics that I was terrible at. I didn't expect it's actually simple, easy, and so much fun. I could be at least quite confident to bring it to my daily project.

### Day 4: July 2 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made a rock paper scissors game with Javascript

**Thoughts**

Create a simple game using Javascript is quite fun. It's so simple when we just play around logic and console, but it's another story when it comes to combine our logic into HTML element and play with css classes.

Now I know that if you `clearInterval()` the `setInterval()` will still run unless you wrap them in an `if else`.

### Day 5: July 3 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Javascript unit tester `Jasmine`

**Thoughts**

I didn't know that there's another unit tester other than `jest`. It's quite fun playing logic and algorithm with Jasmine. From the experience, I learn that my algorithm still quite weak and I still don't know about many things such as rounding numbers without `toFixed()` -- because it turns your number into String, be careful -- temperature ratios, etc. Still so many things to finish inside javascript exercise. Let's save it for tomorrow.

### Day 6: July 4 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade Next JS dashboard boilerplate to v9

**Thoughts**

It's not as simple as I thought, upgrade node js version from 8 to 12.18, upgrade all dependencies, new folder structure and behavior of many libraries suhc as `Next JS, next redux wrapper, styled components, styled system, etc`.

### Day 7: July 5 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finish upgrade Next JS dashboard to v9

**Thoughts**

As I said, migrating system to the newer one is not that simple, I should wary about new behavior, new libraries, updated dependency especially major version of it may be harder than I think. Fortunately all features have been migrated and tested without any error. Fyuh.

It's a nice experience though. I should re-check it.

### Day 8: July 6 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finish Etch sketch task and some javascript algorithm exercises

**Thoughts**

Create a pixelated canvas using HTML grid by using Javascript to generate it is quite easy, but I don't know somehow the performance is quite poor. I'm wondering what is wrong with my code.

On the other hand, javascript exercises today is quite hard. The most difficult task is caesar problem. We should make it circular in alphabet, **the circular** thing is the hardest one, we should _change the direction of encryption_ if it "tembus" below "a" alphabet. Palindrome problem also quite tricky in my opinion.

I think I've met the problem before, but since I am using Javascript instead of C++, I think it becomes easier than back then, but I **really** should learn more about algorithm and make my mind into shape.

### Day 9: July 7 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting calculator project

**Thoughts**

Wondering how to calculate string sequence without using `eval`. An hour isn't enough to figure out the solution, so today I wasted my time on thinking and just writing a small piece of code.

### Day 10: July 8 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finish method to calculate string into number

**Thoughts**

After receiving opinion from Alvis and Faldy to calculate string number sequence , finally finish the core function to calculate them. They suggested using recursion but since I am not good at recursion, I used while loop to solve the problem.

Save the numbers input into string and separate each number and operator with space `" "`, clean then calculate operator `*` and `/` first, then clean and calculate `+` and `-`. Voila you get the result number.

### Day 11: July 9 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Create HTML and CSS for calculator

**Thoughts**

I think this project will take a longer time, due to my concentration splitted between this journey and errors happened in kulina project. I should really take care of my body so it won't be burdened.

### Day 12: July 10 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implement button function to calculator

**Thoughts**

Implement button click function to calculator, it turned out quite simple and I think this project could be finished by this week. I'm surprised tho. After we figure out how to calculate string it really opened up a path. Can't wait to see it finished. Let's add keyboard support or backspace for tomorrow.

### Day 13: July 11 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finish calculator implementation

**Thoughts**

Finally add backspace/delete button and keyboard support. Thus we could assume that this project is finished.

### Day 14: July 12 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learn basic about Ruby

**Thoughts**

Installed all necessities for Ruby programming such as ruby itself, rbenv, heroku.

Learned about ruby starting from basic. There are String, Numbers, Symbol, Hash, Boolean, Array, and also nil.

It's quite different with some programming language I've learned, in ruby we use snake case `this_is_snake_case` instead of camel case `thisIsCamelCase`. I don't know yet but I'm sure both camel case and snake case will work just fine in Ruby, but it's doesn't fit the standard. So let's go along with the standard.

Some operation quite simpler in Ruby than in Javascript, like if we want to reverse a string we could just use `.reverse` to string, in Javascript we should split it to array, reverse, then join it since reverse only works for array. Logical ternary operation also quite different in Ruby, we use `?` at the end of class instance.

Ah there's also string literal which support interpolation (insert code inside the string) just like template literals in Javascript, but it uses double quotation mark `""` and `#{}`.

### Day 15: July 13 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learn data types, variables, input output and conditional logic in Ruby

**Thoughts**

Although I am quite sleepy while do it, I learn about basic data types until conditional logic. The thing is most of them just look alike any other programming language I've ever learned. But it's quite surprising Ruby is more humane.

### Day 16: July 14 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learn loop, recursion, and array in Ruby

**Thoughts**

There are so many array instance method for Array, also playing array with Ruby I think quite fun. It's simpler than in Javascript as per I know till now. But yeaa we won't know later.

### Day 17: July 15 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learn hash, enumerable, and method

**Thoughts**

Most of ruby method are humane, it's so easy to remember and easier to read I think. Well the quite different thing in today's learning is the hash or in Javascript/Java we call it object, or dictionary in python. The way ruby assign value to object key property quite different, and it's preferred to use symbol instead of string.

Anyway if we assign has as we used in Javascript

```ruby
  hash = {
    key1: "value",
    key2: "value2"
  }
```

Each key will be converted to symbol.

### Day 18: July 16 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learn debugging with Pry, problem solving 101, and implement caesar chiper

**Thoughts**

I rarely use debugger even in Javascript because I don't really know what's going on when debugger is hitted. But it turns out my curiousity about debugging answered with Ruby Pry, it becomes easier to debug the code.

Also solving caesar chiper in Ruby is easier as well since by nature array in Ruby is circular. So we only have to store alphabet to array and play with the index.
