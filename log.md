# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepare for the real deal, set up mind, things, devices, start reading the rules in **The Odin Project**.

**Thoughts:** I see many of the course are still to basic, I'm sure I have known some of them and been using in my daily basis. I'll try to re-read it carefully and try to look up for something in case I missed some points when I learned those topics back then. I've thought to skip some step as well since it's too basic. Let's see...

### Day 1: June 29 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google landing page using HTML, CSS (with BEM).

**Thoughts**

It's been a while constructing HTML, CSS, and add some JS without any framework, CLI, helper, etc. My VSCode's emmet doesn't work as I expected as well. Honestly because I mainly focus on create react component on my daily basis, I forgot many things about HTML tags, especially `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

I think I should learn more about BEM CSS and get used to construct website with HTML, CSS, JS without any framework/CLI/helper. Anyway BEM CSS is very interesting, I also should learn more about it!

### Day 2: June 30 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google search result page

**Thoughts**

I didn't expect create website page without any framework will take time so long and so complicated (ribet). I should learn more element naming management so I won't get confused when it comes to giving class name to HTML element.

### Day 3: July 1 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learn about regular expression with The Net Ninja

**Thoughts**

Actually it's a bit cheating since in the rule, online couse shouldn't be counted, well yeah I agree but regex is one of many javascript topics that I was terrible at. I didn't expect it's actually simple, easy, and so much fun. I could be at least quite confident to bring it to my daily project.

### Day 4: July 2 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made a rock paper scissors game with Javascript

**Thoughts**

Create a simple game using Javascript is quite fun. It's so simple when we just play around logic and console, but it's another story when it comes to combine our logic into HTML element and play with css classes.

Now I know that if you `clearInterval()` the `setInterval()` will still run unless you wrap them in an `if else`.

### Day 5: July 3 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Javascript unit tester `Jasmine`

**Thoughts**

I didn't know that there's another unit tester other than `jest`. It's quite fun playing logic and algorithm with Jasmine. From the experience, I learn that my algorithm still quite weak and I still don't know about many things such as rounding numbers without `toFixed()` -- because it turns your number into String, be careful -- temperature ratios, etc. Still so many things to finish inside javascript exercise. Let's save it for tomorrow.
