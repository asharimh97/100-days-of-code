# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepare for the real deal, set up mind, things, devices, start reading the rules in **The Odin Project**.

**Thoughts:** I see many of the course are still to basic, I'm sure I have known some of them and been using in my daily basis. I'll try to re-read it carefully and try to look up for something in case I missed some points when I learned those topics back then. I've thought to skip some step as well since it's too basic. Let's see...

### Day 1: June 29 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google landing page using HTML, CSS (with BEM).

**Thoughts**

It's been a while constructing HTML, CSS, and add some JS without any framework, CLI, helper, etc. My VSCode's emmet doesn't work as I expected as well. Honestly because I mainly focus on create react component on my daily basis, I forgot many things about HTML tags, especially `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

I think I should learn more about BEM CSS and get used to construct website with HTML, CSS, JS without any framework/CLI/helper. Anyway BEM CSS is very interesting, I also should learn more about it!

### Day 2: June 30 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made replica of Google search result page

**Thoughts**

I didn't expect create website page without any framework will take time so long and so complicated (ribet). I should learn more element naming management so I won't get confused when it comes to giving class name to HTML element.

### Day 3: July 1 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learn about regular expression with The Net Ninja

**Thoughts**

Actually it's a bit cheating since in the rule, online couse shouldn't be counted, well yeah I agree but regex is one of many javascript topics that I was terrible at. I didn't expect it's actually simple, easy, and so much fun. I could be at least quite confident to bring it to my daily project.

### Day 4: July 2 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made a rock paper scissors game with Javascript

**Thoughts**

Create a simple game using Javascript is quite fun. It's so simple when we just play around logic and console, but it's another story when it comes to combine our logic into HTML element and play with css classes.

Now I know that if you `clearInterval()` the `setInterval()` will still run unless you wrap them in an `if else`.

### Day 5: July 3 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Javascript unit tester `Jasmine`

**Thoughts**

I didn't know that there's another unit tester other than `jest`. It's quite fun playing logic and algorithm with Jasmine. From the experience, I learn that my algorithm still quite weak and I still don't know about many things such as rounding numbers without `toFixed()` -- because it turns your number into String, be careful -- temperature ratios, etc. Still so many things to finish inside javascript exercise. Let's save it for tomorrow.

### Day 6: July 4 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade Next JS dashboard boilerplate to v9

**Thoughts**

It's not as simple as I thought, upgrade node js version from 8 to 12.18, upgrade all dependencies, new folder structure and behavior of many libraries suhc as `Next JS, next redux wrapper, styled components, styled system, etc`.

### Day 7: July 5 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finish upgrade Next JS dashboard to v9

**Thoughts**

As I said, migrating system to the newer one is not that simple, I should wary about new behavior, new libraries, updated dependency especially major version of it may be harder than I think. Fortunately all features have been migrated and tested without any error. Fyuh.

It's a nice experience though. I should re-check it.

### Day 8: July 6 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finish Etch sketch task and some javascript algorithm exercises

**Thoughts**

Create a pixelated canvas using HTML grid by using Javascript to generate it is quite easy, but I don't know somehow the performance is quite poor. I'm wondering what is wrong with my code.

On the other hand, javascript exercises today is quite hard. The most difficult task is caesar problem. We should make it circular in alphabet, **the circular** thing is the hardest one, we should _change the direction of encryption_ if it "tembus" below "a" alphabet. Palindrome problem also quite tricky in my opinion.

I think I've met the problem before, but since I am using Javascript instead of C++, I think it becomes easier than back then, but I **really** should learn more about algorithm and make my mind into shape.

### Day 9: July 7 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting calculator project

**Thoughts**

Wondering how to calculate string sequence without using `eval`. An hour isn't enough to figure out the solution, so today I wasted my time on thinking and just writing a small piece of code.

### Day 10: July 8 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finish method to calculate string into number

**Thoughts**

After receiving opinion from Alvis and Faldy to calculate string number sequence , finally finish the core function to calculate them. They suggested using recursion but since I am not good at recursion, I used while loop to solve the problem.

Save the numbers input into string and separate each number and operator with space `" "`, clean then calculate operator `*` and `/` first, then clean and calculate `+` and `-`. Voila you get the result number.

### Day 11: July 9 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Create HTML and CSS for calculator

**Thoughts**

I think this project will take a longer time, due to my concentration splitted between this journey and errors happened in kulina project. I should really take care of my body so it won't be burdened.

### Day 12: July 10 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implement button function to calculator

**Thoughts**

Implement button click function to calculator, it turned out quite simple and I think this project could be finished by this week. I'm surprised tho. After we figure out how to calculate string it really opened up a path. Can't wait to see it finished. Let's add keyboard support or backspace for tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Finish calculator implementation

**Thoughts**

Finally add backspace/delete button and keyboard support. Thus we could assume that this project is finished.

### Day 14: July 12 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learn basic about Ruby

**Thoughts**

Installed all necessities for Ruby programming such as ruby itself, rbenv, heroku.

Learned about ruby starting from basic. There are String, Numbers, Symbol, Hash, Boolean, Array, and also nil.

It's quite different with some programming language I've learned, in ruby we use snake case `this_is_snake_case` instead of camel case `thisIsCamelCase`. I don't know yet but I'm sure both camel case and snake case will work just fine in Ruby, but it's doesn't fit the standard. So let's go along with the standard.

Some operation quite simpler in Ruby than in Javascript, like if we want to reverse a string we could just use `.reverse` to string, in Javascript we should split it to array, reverse, then join it since reverse only works for array. Logical ternary operation also quite different in Ruby, we use `?` at the end of class instance.

Ah there's also string literal which support interpolation (insert code inside the string) just like template literals in Javascript, but it uses double quotation mark `""` and `#{}`.

### Day 15: July 13 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learn data types, variables, input output and conditional logic in Ruby

**Thoughts**

Although I am quite sleepy while do it, I learn about basic data types until conditional logic. The thing is most of them just look alike any other programming language I've ever learned. But it's quite surprising Ruby is more humane.

### Day 16: July 14 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learn loop, recursion, and array in Ruby

**Thoughts**

There are so many array instance method for Array, also playing array with Ruby I think quite fun. It's simpler than in Javascript as per I know till now. But yeaa we won't know later.

### Day 17: July 15 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learn hash, enumerable, and method

**Thoughts**

Most of ruby method are humane, it's so easy to remember and easier to read I think. Well the quite different thing in today's learning is the hash or in Javascript/Java we call it object, or dictionary in python. The way ruby assign value to object key property quite different, and it's preferred to use symbol instead of string.

Anyway if we assign has as we used in Javascript

```ruby
  hash = {
    key1: "value",
    key2: "value2"
  }
```

Each key will be converted to symbol.

### Day 18: July 16 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learn debugging with Pry, problem solving 101, and implement caesar chiper

**Thoughts**

I rarely use debugger even in Javascript because I don't really know what's going on when debugger is hitted. But it turns out my curiousity about debugging answered with Ruby Pry, it becomes easier to debug the code.

Also solving caesar chiper in Ruby is easier as well since by nature array in Ruby is circular. So we only have to store alphabet to array and play with the index.

### Day 19: July 17 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Take a day off from Ruby, learn Z-algorithm

**Thoughts**

Z algorithm is used in matching prefix to reduce time and boost performance, it's a DP after all. It's been bugging me since yesterday's test from Kargo. I didn't know WTH was z algorithm, so frustrating.

I need some time to understand the concept and how it works. Fortunately I could understand it quite well, I hope I won't forget it too fast.

### Day 20: July 18 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Do substring and stock picker challenge

**Thoughts**

Implement what I've learn to solve simple problems with Ruby. There are many things I'm not familiar although I know the concept and how to do it. Still need to open documentation frequently especially in Enumerable methods. I should familiarize myself with Ruby much more to be somehow fluent in Ruby. Hahaha

Also reflecting from Z-algorithm and today's exercises, I should learn about solving mathematical problem. I'm so bad at it. Urgh.

### Day 21: July 19 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Do bubble sort challenge and review Ruby Fundamentals

**Thoughts**

Things quite different in swapping array element in ruby. If we try conventional way to swap value, it will result wrong value, so instead of using `temp` variable to store a value, we could swap it right away with `arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]`.

### Day 22: July 20 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learn Proc, Lambda, Block, and OOP in Ruby

**Thoughts**

Proc and Lambda are objects to shorten function/method handler in some class method. For example

```ruby
  ages = [102, 99, 17, 203, 300, 40]
  under_100 = Proc.new { |x| x < 100 }

  ages.select(&under_100)
```

Basically it's just like move function callback with pre-defined function in Javascript. Also about OOP, since it's still "muqadimah" I just learned global variable, instance variable, class variable, and inheritance principle.

### Day 23: July 21 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Codecademy OOP part 2

**Thoughts**

Learned about `public` and `private` methods in Ruby, module, class, `include`, `extend`, as per I see it's not really different compared to Java. Ya iyalah, namanya juga OOP, the basic is just same but the syntax a little bit different.

Ruby also supports us to make big number readable by inserting underscore `_` between them. For example

```ruby
  number = 1_000_000_000 # will read as 1000000000
```

Small thing but I think it will help a lot especially if we make a program with numbers.

### Day 24: July 22 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Create TicTacToe with Ruby

**Thoughts**

It's so challenging create a tic tac toe game in ruby. However, the method used in check winner is still so poor and I can't figured out the simpler way because I couldn't focus due to my sleepiness. Will need to take a look at it some day to figure out better way to check tictactoe problem.

### Day 25: July 23 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Create Mastermind game with Ruby

**Thoughts**

Create game in ruby may be isn't as hard as it seem, but since I'm unfamiliar with some (most of) syntaxes it's quite difficult to pour what in our mind into a code. I want to finish ruby course as fast as possible, but I know that things take time. I need to enjoy it step by step, but I want it to be done. Urgh...

Furthermore when we try to code a game, the hardest part maybe is figuring out the game rules. I also unfamiliar with the games. hnnnnn

I should add computer support to the game. It's now only 1 player game.

### Day 26: July 24 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Mastermind game with Ruby

**Thoughts**

Create class player (computer and human classes as well) to make the game supports for 2 player. But it's still confusing how to separate which class does what. Hmm... Also stopping in the half way is actually such pain in the ass -\_- but my mind got blank, I can't figure out anything. Damn it.

I should take a rest first and continue tomorrow morning when my mind is clear.

**Today's Progress**: Continued Mastermind game with Ruby

**Thoughts**

Modify main file/game class to support player challenges computer in game play. It works fine but computer still couldn't get the correct answer. I will need to learn to make computer save the latest guess if there's correct color so the next guess computer will reuse the used color and win the game within 12 iteration.

### Day 28: July 26 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Create post about Mental Model in Javascript

**Thoughts**

Extract and explain something is harder than learning itself. I should carefully arrange words, sentence, so my explanation will hit the dot. I need to learn more about organizing writing.

### Day 29: July 27 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about I/O and serializations

**Thoughts**

Serializing in Ruby could be done in YAML and JSON, I'm quite familiar with JSON and I don't think I'll have any problem with it, but I'm curious about YAML, maybe I'll use this chance to learn more about YAML.

### Day 30: July 28 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

- Write about assigning value in Javascript
- Continue event manager project

**Thoughts**

I know my writing skill is not really good, it's still circular and wordy, but I realized that explaining a smaller chunk will be better for me, it makes my writing more structured. I think I should decompose the post I want to write into smaller chunks and put in a "series".

### Day 31: July 29 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished event manager project in The Odin Project

**Thoughts**

I was confused how to access class attribute dynamically in ruby at first, but finally I got the answer of my problem, it's using `.send(:attribute_name)`. With that we could access every attribute dynamically.

We could replicate this

```javascript
let dd = new Date();

console.log(dd.getYear());
console.log(dd["getYear"]());
```

into this in Ruby

```ruby
dd = DateTime.new

param = "hour".to_sym

puts dd.hour
puts dd.send(param)
```

Damn! But maybe will need to pay more attention on it, since I don't know if this way of accessing attribute is recommended.

### Day 42: August 9 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Knight Travails assignment

**Thoughts**
I don't know whether the method I am using is graph or not since I don't think I implement adjacent array in my code, but I'm sure I implemented linked list/binary tree in it, since it's used as tracker of steps taken from start position to target position.

It's so much fun yet difficult at the same time.

**Today's Progress**: Playing TDD using Rspec

**Thoughts**
If Javascript has Jasmine as one of its unit testing library, Ruby has `Rspec`. It's quite the same so I don't think there'll be difficulty using it. But I haven't known if it used in the bigger and more complex projects.

Also add unit testing for Caesar Chiper problem

Because I couldn't think about unit test of connect four, I got stuck, my mind went blank, I decided to take a look at my progress at Hackerrank. It's been a while doing some competitive programming things, I thought. Eventually I continue my 30 Days of code from hackerrank tutorial.

I could say that things I learned in the past 43 days helps me solve the problems I saw quite difficult back then.

### Day 45: August 12 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue progress in Hackerrank

**Thoughts**
I still couldn't figure out how to make a good unit test in ruby with Rspec, I decided to continue my Hackerrank progress. It's quite frustrating because hackkerrank environment sometimes behaves weirdly, damnit!

### Day 46: August 13 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Start creating unit test for connect-four game

**Thoughts**
As I said few days ago about testing in ruby seems like testing in Javascript, it's pretty much look alike, I learned about `let`, `have_attributes`, `described_class`, `subject`, `instance_variable_set`. I should break down every class rules to get a clearer things to be tested on.

### Day 47: August 14 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continue unit test for board connect four

**Thoughts**
Successfully create testing logic for `horizontal`, `vertical`, and check if there is 4 consecutive piece in array given to `four_in_a_row?`. Still stuck with diagonal checker but have gotten the inspiration from knight travails problem.

**Today's Progress**: Continue unit test for board connect four

**Thoughts**
Finished all necessary methods for board class and now we could head to game class, but first let's take a break a little bit to ensure the flow of game we want it to be.

### Day 49: August 16 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Discussed personal blog project with Dila

**Thoughts**
Today is not a coding day, I spent my time discussing about her friend's personal web project. We had a lot of fun discussing this. I couldn't wait to get involved in this project. The good news is, they trusted us to do this project. Woah!

### Day 50: August 17 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished connect four game

**Thoughts**
Finished class game and finish game connect four code, although I couldn't create the TDD for class game but I think the MVP of this lesson is the basic way to test ruby. And I somehow get the grasp. Well I think I could consider it as done for now.

### Day 51: August 18 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Research for chess project and blue at hue project

**Thoughts**
I haven't known how to fully implement chess' rules into code. Needs to see more references.

### Day 52: August 19 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Initialize and prepare chess game

**Thoughts**
I haven't fully find a way to make the game works, especially when deals with how to generate possible moves efficiently.

### Day 53: August 20 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Create UI for Blueathue project

**Thoughts**
I am still thinking about how to solve the chess problem tho, but I haven't fully learn about the rule especially to determine when will we estimate that opponent's king is in check/mate, or how to determine it's a stalemate, or even how to do "lukir" or castling. Hmmm...

### Day 55: August 22 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continue chess game project

**Thoughts**
Implement moves for bishop, queen, king, and pawn. The pawn attacking moves is not possible to be implemented inside the `Pawn` class, it's better to implement the moves inside the board game class later on.

Note: Should try to figure out how to generate a real possible moves in board later on as well, which identify if pieces (except knight) path is get blocked, there'll be no further step.

### Day 56: August 23 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continue chess game project and present Blueathue prototype

**Thoughts**
Create board methods to be used in the game later on. Also presented UI prototype to Aysah, it's a good experience, I was so freakin' nervous and "gagap", I should refine my public speaking skill for once more so I wouldn't do speech filler too much.

### Day 60: August 27 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continue chess project, write down each test case

**Thoughts**
Since I am not using usual technique to generate possible moves, it's quite difficult to deal with determine if path from starting coordinate to destination coordinate is clear. But I think I got a glimpse.

What if we separate each movements

```
// [x, y]

horizontal_left = [-1, 0] -> [-7, 0]
horizontal_right = [1, 0] -> [7, 0]
vertical_up = [0, 1] -> [0, 7]
vertical_down = [0, -1] -> [0, -7]

diagonal_bottom_left = [-1, -1] -> [-7, -7]
diagonal_up_right = [1, 1] -> [7, 7]
diagonal_up_left = [-1, 1] -> [-7, 7]
diagonal_bottom_right = [1, -1] -> [7, -7]

// group each of them into array, then do a loop for each group, if there's obstacle, it means that's the coordinate limit
```

**Today's Progress**: Continue chess project, implement game rules and update generate possible moves

**Thoughts**
Implemented yesterday's thought of pieces' possible moves, I think it will be easier for now to deal with checking if path is blocked without using tree. Waaaahh mantap gan.

**Today's Progress**: Working on Blueathue revisions (styling, logo), continue chess project

**Thoughts**
Add some patch due to class naming incompatibility in Wordpress, start create the logo for blueathue, and implemented movement validation. So long it's worked, it generates the valid moves of each piece type with considering if path is blocked by opponent/our own piece.

### Day 63: August 30 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on chess project `check/skak` validation

**Thoughts**
It turns out quite difficult since I don't have a mock board nor tree to generate each pieces possible movements, so I need another way to validate if opponent's king is surrounded by the end of our turn.

### Day 64: August 31 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: BAD NEWS! My Macbook is injured

**Thoughts**
I think the power board in my macbook is broken, it doesn't want to turn on. So unexpected, there's no symptoms, uuuhhh. I ended up borrow Jennie's laptop but I get confused with Elementary OS. Hmm...

### Day 65: September 1 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Change Jennie's laptop to office's Macbook

**Thoughts**
I'm quite ewuh using Jennie's laptop, so I ask office if there's a device unused this time and it turns out there's a Macbook unused in office, reconfig it, to support my works and 100 days of code streak. I think I could continue my chess project effectively started from tomorrow.

### Day 66: September 2 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue chess project, implement check logic

**Thoughts**
Fix some pieces movement logic because it causes invalid possible movements and implemented the check logic. It's as it written, but I haven't check it further so we need to check it further to make sure my logic is working as I planned.

### Day 67: September 3 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Discussed Digitiket V2 project

**Thoughts**
Spent my time discuss about the proposed Digitiket UI with Ucil, I learn a lot from him, a perspective from a UI designer in making a website, I also used my experiences as a frontend developer to give him some opinions, we had so much fun. It will be very awesome if I could be involved in this project as the frontend developer.

**Today's Progress**: Learned SOLID Principle in Javascript

**Thoughts**
I don't know but the more I read article about SOLID principle I still couldn't get a grasp of it. Hhhh, so frustrating.

### Day 77: September 13 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continue learn SOLID principle by discussing with Faldy and start todo project

**Thoughts**
Still confused about SOLID principle a bit but I think I have get a grasp of it.

Create todo project with vanilla JS is something. Usually we could auto update DOM with react or vue but in vanilla JS we should do it manually. Hmm, it's quite challenging.
